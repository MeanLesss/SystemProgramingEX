You are a *******. I hate you.  I hate the fact you exist.  You are s*******.  You are an absolute *******ing *******.  You are a lowlife piece of human garbage.  You absolute *******ing ******* *******.  You are a waste of a human being.  You've done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that's important.  You dumb *******, you piece of *******.  You're not even a son of a *******, that's too dignified a term for what you are.  You know, you're not even human.  You don't deserve the word human because you are that much of a *******ing disgrace to people all around the globe, worldwide.  It's a dishonor to put you in the same sentence with that word,  you *******hole. Are you *******ing proud of yourself?  Are you proud of having accomplished absolutely nothing in your life?  You have only done bad things in this world.  You do not deserve to live, you *******.  You are a terrible excuse for a human being.  You are an ABSOLUTE *******. You are nothing but a *******got brainlet.  You sleazy two-faced *******. You slimy sluggish *******hole.  You TRIFLING mother*******er. A quote from a co-worker of mine as we were driving through Oakland California one day looking at a “Hood Rat” with his gold bling around his ne******* and in his mouth….Look at that STUPID MFer…..He’s so Effing STUPID he doesn’t Effing know how Effing STUPID HE LOOKS that EFFING DUMB MFer!  This particular co-worker was of a melanin heavy cons*******uency himself….I about wre*******ed the company tru******* laughing as I told him he probably made the Guinness book on the highest amount of explicatives used in a single sentance by a person You can’t.  You need other words, like pronouns, to be the object of the sentence.  If you say “*******,” for example, you need “him” or “you” or “it” to tell us whom, or what, should be metaphorically *******ed.  You can issue the command “******* ******* up,” but you still need “up” as the adverbial particle. In Glaswegian Scots, “fook” is a place you can “get tae” (the complete sentence, “Get tae fook,” means “Please depart immediately, or possible harm to your person may ensue”). But you still need those other little words in the sentence.  Of course, if you are Samuel L. Ja*******son, “mother*******er” is a complete sentence. The Star Wars prequels become 300% more bearable if you add that fine word to the end of his dialogue:  “This party’s over, mother*******er.” (Episode II, to Count Dooku) “I don’t think so, mother*******er.” (same scene) “You’re under arrest, mother*******er.” (Episode III, to Chancellor Palpatine)
